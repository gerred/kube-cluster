# Contributing

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch and commit your code into that feature branch. Include the standard license header (see LICENSE-HEADER) at the top of new files.
3. Pull request the feature branch against the main repository early. This allows conversation around the PR.
4. Include new dependencies in godep with `godep save -r ./...`
5. Once two core contributors have provided their sign-off, the PR will be merged into master.
